VERSION 1.2.1

2014-05-11 Joel Lawhead <jlawhead@geospatialpython.com>
	*shapefile.py (u) fixed bug which failed to properly read some dbf fields in Python 3

VERSION 1.2.0

2013-09-05 Joel Lawhead <jlawhead@geospatialpython.com>
	*README.txt add example/test for writing a 3D polygon

VERSION 1.1.9

2013-07-27 Joel Lawhead <jlawhead@geospatialpython.com>
	*shapefile.py (Writer.__shpRecords) fixed inconsistency between Reader and Writer
	when referencing "z" and "m" values.  This bug caused errors only when editing
	3D shapefiles.

VERSION 1.1.8

2013-07-02 Joel Lawhead <jlawhead@geospatialpython.com>
	*shapefile.py (Writer.poly()) fixed a bug that resulted in incorrect part indexes
	*README.txt updated several errors in the documentation.

2013-06-25 Joel Lawhead <jlawhead@geospatialpython.com>
	*shapefile.py (Reader.shapes(),Reader.iterShapes()) Updated to verify the file length by
	seeking to the end. A user reported shapefiles in the wild which had incorrect .shp file
	lengths reported in the header which crashed when reading or iterating shapes.  Most
	insist on using the .shx file but there's no real reason to do so.

VERSION 1.1.7

2013-06-22 Joel Lawhead <jlawhead@geospatialpython.com>

	*shapefile.py (_Shape.__geo_interface__) Added Python __geo_interface__ convention
	to export shapefiles as GeoJSON.

	*shapefile.py (Reader.__init__) Used is_string() method to detect filenames passed
	as unicode strings.

	*shapefile.py (Reader.iterShapes) Added iterShapes() method to iterate through
	geometry records for parsing large files efficiently.

	*shapefile.py (Reader.iterRecords) Added iterRecords() method to iterate through
	dbf records efficiently in large files.

	*shapefile.py (Reader.shape) Modified shape() method to use iterShapes() if shx
	file is not available.

	*shapefile.py (main) Added __version__ attribute.

	*shapefile.py (Writer.record) Fixed bug which prevents writing the number 0 to
	dbf fields.

	*shapefile.py (Reader.__shape) Updated to calculate and seek the start of the next record. The
	shapefile spec does not require the content of a geometry record to be as long as the content
	length defined in the header.  The result is you can delete features without modifying the
	record header allowing for empty space in records.

	*shapefile.py (Writer.poly) Added enforcement of closed polygons

	*shapefile.py (Writer.save) Added unique file name generator to use if no file names are passed
	to a writer instance when saving (ex. w.save()).  The unique file name is returned as a string.

	*README.txt (main) Added tests for iterShapes(), iterRecords(), __geo_interface__()

	*README.txt (main) Updated "bbox" property documentation to match Esri specification.
